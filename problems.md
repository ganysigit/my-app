# Problems Log

## Problem 1: Analytics Endpoint TypeError ✅ SOLVED
**Date**: Current session
**Error**: `TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object` when accessing `/api/dashboard/stats`
**Analysis**: The analytics endpoint was trying to process database query results that could be null or undefined, particularly when the database was empty or when using `Object.entries()` on potentially null values.
**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. Identified the error in server logs showing 500 status
2. Examined the analytics endpoint code structure
3. Found unsafe data processing without null checks
**Solution**: 
- Added proper null/undefined checks for all database query results
- Used optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`||`) operators
- Restructured data processing to handle empty database scenarios
- Changed from nested object structure to flat structure matching dashboard expectations

## Problem 6: Dashboard Data Structure TypeError ✅ SOLVED
**Date**: Current session
**Error**: `TypeError: _stats_issuesByStatus.find is not a function`
**Analysis**: The dashboard expected `issuesByStatus` to be an array that supports `.find()` method, but the analytics endpoint was returning it as a key-value object after my previous restructuring.
**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. Used sequential thinking MCP to analyze the error systematically
2. Examined dashboard interface definition expecting arrays
3. Found mismatch between endpoint response (object) and dashboard expectation (array)
**Solution**:
- Modified analytics endpoint to return `issuesByStatus` and `issuesBySeverity` as arrays
- Changed from `.reduce()` to `.map()` to maintain array structure
- Updated response structure to match dashboard interface exactly
- Verified endpoint returns 200 status and dashboard loads without errors

## Problem 2: PowerShell Command Compatibility ✅ SOLVED
**Date**: Current session
**Error**: `curl` command not recognized in PowerShell environment
**Analysis**: The development environment uses PowerShell where `curl` is an alias for `Invoke-WebRequest` with different syntax
**Solution**: Used `Invoke-WebRequest` with proper PowerShell syntax instead of Unix-style `curl` commands

## Problem 3: Dashboard Data Structure Mismatch ✅ SOLVED
**Date**: Current session
**Error**: Dashboard expecting different data structure than what analytics endpoint provided
**Analysis**: The dashboard was updated to expect a flat data structure, but the analytics endpoint was returning nested objects
**Solution**: 
- Restructured analytics endpoint response to match dashboard expectations
- Simplified data structure from nested objects to flat properties
- Ensured all expected fields are present in the response

## Problem 4: Cron Job Instance Method Missing ✅ SOLVED
**Date**: Previous session
**Error**: SyncService only had static methods, but cron jobs needed instance methods
**Analysis**: Vercel cron jobs work better with instance methods for proper context and state management
**Solution**: Added instance method `syncMapping()` to SyncService class that internally calls the static method

## Problem 5: Discord Connection Failed Error ✅ SOLVED
**Date**: Current session
**Error**: `ReferenceError: DiscordService is not defined` and `Discord connection failed` during sync operations
**Analysis**: 
1. Initial error was due to outdated references to `DiscordService` class that was replaced with `SimpleDiscordService`
2. After fixing references, discovered `SimpleDiscordService` constructor didn't accept `discordChannel` parameter
3. The class had no constructor, so `token` property remained null, causing `testConnection()` to fail immediately
**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. Updated all `DiscordService` references to `SimpleDiscordService` in sync.ts and route.ts
2. Used sequential thinking MCP to analyze the connection failure
3. Examined `SimpleDiscordService` class structure and `testConnection()` method
4. Found missing constructor that should extract `botToken` from `discordChannel` object
**Solution**:
- Added proper constructor to `SimpleDiscordService` that accepts `discordChannel` parameter
- Constructor extracts `botToken` and `channelId` from the passed object

## Problem 6: Notion API Property Type Mismatch Error ✅ SOLVED
**Date**: Current session
**Error**: `The property type in the database does not match the property type of the filter provided: database property status does not match filter select` in `fetchOpenIssues` at `lib/services/notion.ts:33`
**Analysis**: 
1. The code was using a hardcoded `select` filter for the `status` property
2. The actual Notion database `status` property was likely a different type (multi_select, checkbox, status, or formula)
3. Notion API requires different filter syntax for different property types
**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. Used sequential thinking MCP to analyze the error systematically
2. Used Context7 MCP to retrieve up-to-date Notion API documentation
3. Examined the current filter implementation in `fetchOpenIssues` method
4. Identified the need for dynamic property type detection
**Solution**:
- Added `getDatabaseSchema()` method to retrieve database property types from Notion API
- Added `createStatusFilter()` private method to dynamically create filters based on actual property type
- Updated `fetchOpenIssues()` to first fetch schema, then apply correct filter
- Added `createStatusUpdate()` method for dynamic status updates in `updateIssueStatus()`
- Added comprehensive error handling for missing status properties

## Problem 7: Missing cleanup Method in SimpleDiscordService ✅ SOLVED
**Date**: Current session
**Error**: `TypeError: discordService.cleanup is not a function` during sync operations
**Analysis**: 
1. The `SyncService` calls `discordService.cleanup()` after processing issues
2. `SimpleDiscordService` class was missing the `cleanup()` method
3. The method exists in `SimpleDiscordClient` but not in the service wrapper
**Solution**:
- Added `cleanup()` method to `SimpleDiscordService` class
- Method calls `disconnect()` to properly clean up resources
- Sync operations now complete successfully without errors
- Updated `testConnection()` method to use configured `channelId` and added better error logging
- Verified fix by testing sync endpoint - now returns 200 OK instead of Discord connection errors

## Problem 6: Notion API Property Type Mismatch ❌ ACTIVE
**Date**: Current session
**Error**: `APIResponseError: The property type in the database does not match the property type of the filter provided: database property status does not match filter select`
**Analysis**: The Notion service is trying to filter by a 'status' property using a select filter, but the actual property type in the Notion database doesn't match this expectation
**Location**: `lib/services/notion.ts:33` in `fetchOpenIssues()` method
**Next Steps**: Need to examine the Notion database schema and update the filter to match the actual property type

## Problem 5: Missing Discord Interactions Package ✅ SOLVED
**Date**: Previous session
**Error**: `discord-interactions` package not installed for webhook verification
**Analysis**: Webhook signature verification requires the official Discord interactions package
**Solution**: Installed `discord-interactions` package via npm

## Problem 7: Discord.js zlib-sync Module Resolution Error ✅ SOLVED
**Date**: Current session
**Error**: `Module not found: Can't resolve 'zlib-sync'` in `@discordjs/ws/dist/index.js:573:54`
**Analysis**: Discord.js tries to dynamically import the optional `zlib-sync` dependency for compression features, but it's not installed and requires native compilation with Visual Studio build tools.
**Root Cause**: 
- `zlib-sync` is an optional dependency that requires native compilation
- Windows environment lacks Visual Studio build tools for native module compilation
- Next.js webpack configuration wasn't properly handling optional dependencies
**Solution**: 
1. Installed alternative optional dependencies: `bufferutil` and `utf-8-validate`
2. Updated `next.config.ts` webpack configuration to:
   - Externalize `zlib-sync` for server-side builds
   - Set `zlib-sync: false` in resolve.fallback for client-side builds
   - Added fallbacks for other optional Discord.js dependencies (`erlpack`, `node:zlib`, `node:util`)
3. Restarted development server to apply webpack changes

## Lessons Learned
1. Always handle null/undefined database results gracefully
2. Use environment-appropriate commands (PowerShell vs bash)
3. Ensure API response structures match frontend expectations
4. Consider deployment environment requirements when designing service methods
5. Verify all required packages are installed and documented
